# CodeAlpha_C-Matrix-Operation-Program
This C program performs Matrix Operations using functions and 2D arrays. It includes:  Matrix Addition (if dimensions are same)  Matrix Multiplication (if valid: cols of A = rows of B)  Transpose of a Matrix  The program is menu-driven and demonstrates modular programming by separating each operation into functions.
