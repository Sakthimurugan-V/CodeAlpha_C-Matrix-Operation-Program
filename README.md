# 🔢 Matrix Operations in C

This project implements basic **Matrix Operations** using **C programming** with functions and 2D arrays.  
It is a **menu-driven program** that allows users to perform the following:

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Matrix Addition** (when both matrices are of the same dimension)  
- ✖ **Matrix Multiplication** (when cols of A = rows of B)  
- 🔄 **Matrix Transpose**  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language  
- GCC Compiler (or any C compiler)  

## 📂 File Structure


MatrixOperations.c # Main program file


## ▶️ How to Run
1. Save the file as `MatrixOperations.c`
2. Open terminal / command prompt
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc MatrixOperations.c -o MatrixOperations


Run the executable:

./MatrixOperations
